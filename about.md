# Jumpscare

Randomly jumpscares you when you die

My **attempt** at recreating MegaHack's Jumpscare module

You can set the **probability** in the mod settings, as well as the **textures and sound** for the jumpscare by pressing the pencil button next to the mod settings button

(**You must restart the game for the change to take place**!)

**For Android:** The pencil button doesn't currently work, please manually go to `/storage/0/Android/media/com.geode.launcher/game/geode/config/weebify.jumpscare`
