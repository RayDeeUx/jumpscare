# Jumpscare

Randomly jumpscares you when you die

My **attempt** at recreating MegaHack's Jumpscare module

You can change the **behavior** of the mod in the mod settings

# How to change/add your own jumpscare

To <cl>access this mod's config folder</c>, open the mod's settings popup and press the <cg>Open Config Folder</c> button.

To <cr>add your own jumpscare</c>, make a new folder in the config folder and add your assets in it.

The assets must include 2 files: `"jumpscare.png"` for the jumpscare image, and `"jumpscareAudio.mp3"` for the jumpscare audio.

### Example files structure:
