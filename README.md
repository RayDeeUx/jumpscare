# Jumpscare

This is where she makes a mod.

My **attempt** at recreating MegaHack's Jumpscare module

You can change the **behavior** of the mod in the mod settings

# How to change/add your own jumpscare

To **access this mod's config folder**, click the pencil button next to the mod settings button below.

To **add your own jumpscare**, make a new folder in the config folder and add your assets in it.

The assets must include 2 files: `"jumpscare.png"` for the jumpscare image, and `"jumpscareAudio.mp3"` for the jumpscare audio.

Example files structure:
```
config/weebify.jumpscare/
├── jumpscare/
│   ├── jumpscare.png
│   └── jumpscareAudio.mp3
└── gdcologne/
    ├── jumpscare.png
    └── jumpscareAudio.mp3
```
